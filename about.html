                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
                <p class="mb-4"> I always envisioned my dream as becoming an instrumentation and control engineer,
                    working on an offshore platform in the oil and gas industryâ€”conducting tests and making repairs for
                    instrumentation tools. This dream seemed fitting with my Higher Diploma in Instrumentation and
                    Control Engineering. However, after three years in the industry, I took a leap into the hospitality
                    sector. There, I discovered a passion for customer service, human resources, and staff training.
                    Despite being versatile in marketing, business management, budgeting, complaint resolution, and
                    compliance, I couldn't shake a sense of indifference. I yearned to learn more, something different.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4"> The missing spark ignited when I clicked play on my first HTML tutorial video. My
                    passion for coding came alive as I executed commands according to instructions. To further my
                    education, I applied for a Computer Science BSc at Customs and Finance Dnipro, Ukraine, in May 2021.
                    Unfortunately, a war broke out in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, marking the largest
                    attack on a European country since World War II. However, this is a story for another day. </p>
                <p class="mb-4"> Fast forward to my arrival in Germany, where I worked with Tesla Gigafactory.
                    Leveraging skills acquired as an instrumentation and control engineer and hospitality manager, I
                    delved into the renewable energy-saving industry. This diverse experience shaped my knowledge. </p>
                <p class="mb-4"> Currently, I'm back to my coding spark, on a roadmap to becoming a DevOps engineer. My
                    expertise includes rapidly acquiring new skills and programming languages, problem-solving,
                    domain-driven design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and proficiency in the
                    Model View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of code organization. I've mastered
                    C#, .Net Framework, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Git/GitHub.
                    Enthusiastically, I'm embracing any programming languages, frameworks, or principles that can
                    enhance the web of code in my mind. </p>
